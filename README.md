üöÄ PortBuster

PortBuster is a lightweight Python-based TCP port scanner that lets you scan open, closed, or filtered ports on a target host ‚Äî with style üßë‚Äçüíª

No need for heavy tools like Nmap ‚Äî this one's simple, fast, and speaks emoji üòé

‚ú® Features:
- üîß Scan well-known ports (1‚Äì1024)
- üéØ Custom port selection (e.g., 22, 80, 443)
- üí£ Full-range scan (1‚Äì65535) ‚Äî for the brave ones
- ‚è±Ô∏è Adjustable timeout (great for slower networks)
- üìü Clean and readable output

üíª Example usage:
> python portbuster.py

You'll be prompted like this:

    Enter target IP address: 192.168.1.1
    üîß Scan mode:
      [1] Ports 1 to 1024
      [2] Custom ports (e.g., 22,80,443)
      [3] Full scan (1 to 65535) üß®üí£üí•
    Select scan mode (1/2/3): 2
    ‚è±Ô∏è  Enter timeout in seconds (default = 2): 1

‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer:
This tool is for educational and authorized use only.  
Do NOT use it to scan targets you don‚Äôt own or have no permission to test.  
Or the FBI van might come knocking üöêüïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
